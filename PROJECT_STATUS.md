## 🏛️ Historic Significance

**October 13, 2025** marks the founding date of constitutional technology—when the first complete framework for democratic AI governance was released to the world.

This framework:
- Proves constitutional AI is practical (not just theoretical)
- Provides working alternative to surveillance capitalism
- Creates new software licensing category with democratic propagation
- Establishes pathway from individual privacy to civilizational change

**The Lifeboat Protocol ensures this framework survives and propagates without centralized authority.** Constitutional principles are self-enforcing through technical architecture.
