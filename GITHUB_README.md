## 🎯 Constitutional Principles Enforced

### 7 Immutable Sovereign Rights

1. **Absolute Data Ownership** 🏠
   - Users own their data fundamentally
   - Data cannot be taken without explicit consent

2. **Local-First Architecture** 💾
   - Data resides locally by default
   - Privacy enabled through sovereignty design

3. **Zero-Knowledge Encryption** 🔐
   - Cryptographic privacy protection
   - Service providers never see user data

4. **Active Revocable Consent** ✅
   - Granular, time-limited permissions
   - Instant withdrawal capability

5. **Right to Be Forgotten** 🗑️
   - One-click permanent data deletion
   - Cryptographically verified erasure

6. **No Tracking/Profiling** 🚫
   - Zero surveillance capabilities
   - No behavioral data collection

7. **Democratic Governance** 🗳️
   - Byzantine consensus voting
   - Stakeholder sovereignty authority

## 🌐 Federation Joining & Participation

### Deploy Your Sovereign Node

1. **Fork Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sovereign-Knowledge-Federation.git
   cd Sovereign-Knowledge-Federation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate Sovereign Keys** (Important: Never commit real keys!):
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   # Use this for NODE_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable
   ```

4. **Configure Federation Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   # Update federation_server.py with your public address
   export FEDERATION_HOST=your-public-host
   export FEDERATION_PORT=8765
   ```

5. **Launch Sovereign Federation**:
   ```bash
   python websocket_federation_server.py
   ```

6. **Connect to Global Network**:
   - Nodes automatically discover peers through constitutional handshakes
   - Join existing federations or establish new sovereign networks
   - All connections require constitutional compliance verification

## 🔒 Security & Sovereignty

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Never Trust**: Constitutions and cryptographic verification mandatory
- **Always Verify**: All actions require sovereignty and consent validation
- **Fail Open**: Governance failures preserve, not obstruct, federation operations

### Cryptographic Sovereignty
- **Sign All Actions**: Every federation event cryptographically signed
- **Validate Authorization**: Seven constitutional rights algorithmically enforced
- **Preserve Privacy**: Zero-knowledge protocols protect all communications
- **Immutable Audit**: Tamper-evident logs ensure accountability without surveillance

### Key Management (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Generate your sovereign keys (NEVER commit to repository!)
export NODE_PRIVATE_KEY="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"
export NODE_PUBLIC_KEY="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"

# Use different keys for different roles
export GOVERNANCE_PRIVATE_KEY="..."  # Override authority keys
export FEDERATION_PRIVATE_KEY="..."  # Network participation keys
```
