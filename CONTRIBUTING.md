## üìã Contribution Process

### Step 1: Understand the Framework

Before contributing, read:
1. [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) - The supreme law
2. [TECHNICAL_FRAMEWORK.md](TECHNICAL_FRAMEWORK.md) - Implementation requirements
3. [HUMAN_HANDBOOK.md](HUMAN_HANDBOOK.md) - Practical guidance

**Key Principles:**
- Local-first architecture (offline-first)
- Zero-knowledge encryption (client-side keys)
- Fail-open governance (never block users)
- Explicit consent (granular, revocable)
- Democratic accountability (Byzantine consensus)

### Step 2: Find or Create an Issue

**Existing Issues:**
- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/thowardii/cosmic-os-constitutional-ai-framework/issues)
- Look for `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` labels
- Comment to express interest and get assigned

**New Issues:**
- **Bug Reports:** Use standard bug template
- **Constitutional Violations:** Use [Constitutional Violation Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/constitutional_violation.md)
- **Governance Proposals:** Use [Governance Proposal](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/governance_proposal.md)
- **Feature Requests:** Describe how it enhances constitutional principles

### Step 3: Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cosmic-os-constitutional-ai-framework.git
cd cosmic-os-constitutional-ai-framework

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `constitutional/` - Constitutional amendments
- `governance/` - Governance proposals

### Step 4: Make Changes

**Constitutional Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] Local-first: Does it work offline?
- [ ] Zero-knowledge: Is data encrypted client-side?
- [ ] Consent: Is user consent required and revocable?
- [ ] Deletion: Can users delete their data?
- [ ] No tracking: Does it avoid surveillance?
- [ ] Fail-open: Does governance enhance, not block?
- [ ] Tests: Are constitutional compliance tests included?

**Code Style:**
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Include inline comments explaining constitutional compliance
- Add docstrings referencing constitutional articles

**Example:**
```python
def save_user_data(user_id: str, data: dict):
    """
    Save user data locally (Constitutional Article II.2 - Local-First).

    Args:
        user_id: User identifier
        data: User data to save

    Constitutional Compliance:
        - Data saved locally first (never cloud-first)
        - User owns the data (Right I)
        - Cloud sync optional and consent-gated (Right IV)
    """
    # Always save locally first
    local_storage.save(user_id, data)

    # Cloud sync only if user consented
    if consent_manager.has_consent(user_id, ConsentType.CLOUD_SYNC):
        cloud_sync.replicate(user_id, data)
```

### Step 5: Test Thoroughly

**Required Tests:**
1. **Functional Tests:** Does the code work?
2. **Constitutional Compliance Tests:** Does it respect all seven rights?
3. **Security Tests:** Is encryption implemented correctly?
4. **Offline Tests:** Does it work without network?

**Example Constitutional Test:**
```typescript
describe('Feature - Constitutional Compliance', () => {
  it('RIGHT II: Works offline', async () => {
    setNetworkEnabled(false);
    const result = await feature.execute();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('RIGHT III: Encrypts before cloud sync', async () => {
    const data = { sensitive: 'user data' };
    await feature.syncToCloud(data);
    const serverData = await cloudStorage.getRaw();
    expect(serverData).not.toContain('user data');
  });

  it('RIGHT IV: Requires consent', async () => {
    await consentManager.revokeConsent(ConsentType.FEATURE);
    const result = await feature.execute();
    expect(result.error).toBe('CONSENT_REQUIRED');
  });
});
```

### Step 6: Commit with Constitutional Reference

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: [Feature Name]

Constitutional Compliance:
- Article II.1: Data ownership preserved
- Article II.2: Local-first implementation
- Article II.4: Explicit consent required

Implementation:
- Zero-knowledge encryption with user keys
- Fail-open governance wrapper
- Constitutional compliance tests
